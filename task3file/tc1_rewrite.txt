How to learn python?

Referencing the official tutorial is a good way to know. You don't need to memorize the usage of all APIs, just remember the most commonly used APIs.

Try writing some programs yourself. With practice, you'll develop your own programming style, know how to solve common problems, and how to seek professional help.

Another good way to know is to read other people's code (such as the code on github) and know how others solve problems.
