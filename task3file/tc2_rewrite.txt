How xx learn python?


Sammy


Referencing the official tutorial is a good way xx learn. You don't need xx memorize the usage of all APIs, just remember the most commonly used APIs.
Try writing some programs yourself. With practice, you'll develop your own programming style, know how xx solve common problems, and how xx seek professional help.

Another good way xx learn is xx read other people's code (such as the code on github) and learn how others solve problems.
